# jest-puppeteer-wn21
Testing with Jest/Puppeteer

This code in this repo is originally from 
https://github.com/academind/js-testing-introduction

It's the core code of the following tutorial:
https://academind.com/tutorials/javascript-testing-introduction/

We're using it in JavaScript classes so we can edit the code

We've chosen not to fork the code as the changes we make are not intended to 
update the tutorial, therefore so we don't clutter the tutorial with hundreds of 
unnecessary forks, we've used the import feature which disassociates our repo from 
the original, hence this notice of the origin of the code found here.

This repo does NOT include all the branches of the original, just the starting point.
